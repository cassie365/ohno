# Oh no!
A virtual uno clone.

## Goals
Primary goal with this project is to create a virtual game that follows rules similar to uno. This game is played between 2 players, the user and the computer. Hands will be drawn from a pot of 108 cards.

The game is then played normally with each player taking turns to place down cards.

## Calling 'Oh no!'
Calling ohno must be done manually by each player.

The computer player will call this as necessary only a percentage of the time, so the human player CAN trip the computer up if it isn't called.

## Iteration 1
- Playable through the command line following typical uno rules

##Iteration 2
- Playable with a GUI using JavaFX
