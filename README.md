# Oh no!
A virtual uno clone.

## Goals
Primary goal with this project is to create a virtual game that follows rules similar to uno. This game is played between 2 players. Hands will be drawn from a pot of 108 cards.

The game is then played normally with each player taking turns to place down cards.

## Calling 'Oh no!'
Calling ohno must be done manually by each player. Failure to do so will result in an automatic penalty draw.

## Iteration 1
- Playable through the command line following typical uno rules
- Players will take turns using the same device
- Using the console as the interface for the game with intentions to add a UI in later iterations
- Allow for different 'flavors' of the game to be added with different cards or rules

## Iteration 2
- Playable with a GUI using JavaFX
